Project Edge.

Edge is a microarchitecture implementation for mips1 ISA written in Verilog HDL. 
It has a 32 bit datapath divided into five pipeline stages operating at 50 MHz
frequency. Supporting timer and other interrupt types and exceptions is implemented through
co-processor0. Edge has been tested and verified on Atlys that has a Spartan-6 XC6SLX45 FPGA.
For the Atlys board, UART driver is provided to communicate with PC at 115200
baud rate. 

The project has started back in 2013.
